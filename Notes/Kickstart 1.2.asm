        ; flagged by a "RomTag".  For an example of what a RomTag looks
        ; like, check out the one at the very beginning of the exec.

        ; The start and end addresses of each piece of CPU address space
        ; to look for RomTags in are given in a table, to which A0 must
        ; point on entry.

        ; A temporary list is built, containing nodes which each point to
        ; a RomTag.  Each resident module has a name, and no two modules
        ; with the same name are allowed.  If there is a conflict, the
        ; one with the higher version number or priority wins and the
        ; other one is discarded.

        ; After the list of RomTags has been compiled, we process something
        ; called the KickMemPtr and the KickTagPtr, found in the ExecBase
        ; structure.  The former points to a chain of MemLists.  The latter
        ; points to an odd type of chain containing pointers to RomTags.

        ; comments at the appropriate code.

        ; All the MemList structures, and tables of RomTag addresses, pointed
        ; to by these pointers, have a checksum, also stored in ExecBase.
        ; If the checksum we calculate doesn't match that checksum, we
        ; discard all the data (assume it has been damaged in a system crash

        ; The routine is called with the alert number and parameters stored
        ; at LastAlert in the ExecBase structure.  This routine reads the
        ; alert number from there and decides what to do with it.

        ; An alert number of -1 means that no alert was outstanding, and
        ; therefore, the routine returns right away.  This means that if
        ; it is called via the "alert.hook" mechanism, and no alert was
        ; pending from before the reboot, nothing will happen.

        ; If the alert number is not -1, an alert will be generated.  The
        ; following algorithm is used to decide what the first string in
        ; the alert should say.

        ; IF the alert number is of the form xxxx01xxxxxxxx THEN

        ; field in ExecBase.  If this is not -1, then an alert is still
        ; outstanding (from before the reboot), and this puts it up, lets

        ; system comes up.
